<h2> Description </h2>
<p align="justify">
  I am creating Apache Kafka for absolute beginners course to help you understand the Apache Kafka Stack, the architecture of Kafka components, Kafka Client APIs (Producers and Consumers) and apply that knowledge to create Kafka programs in Java. 
</p>

<h3>Who should take this Course?</h3>
<p align="justify">
This course is designed for software engineers, solution architects, and managers willing to implement Kafka and solve real-time stream processing problems. I am also creating this course for data architects and data engineers who are responsible for designing and building the organizationâ€™s data-centric infrastructure. Another group of people is the managers and architects who do not directly work with Kafka implementation. Still, they work with the people who implement Kafka Streams at the ground level.
